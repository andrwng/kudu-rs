- Wrap the request protobuf of krpc::Request in an Arc so that multiple RPCs can
  be in flight at once and share the same underlying message. This is
  important, especially, for speculative execution.

- Combine krpc::Request and krpc::Descriptor into krpc::Call.
- The internal in-flight call in krpc should be renamed Rpc. Rpc is just a
  type-erased Call.
